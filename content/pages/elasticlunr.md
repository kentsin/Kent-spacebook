It seems that using lunr.js is possible solution. 

what does not work is in browser side it need also have the same stemmer. but actually it does not need segmenter for cjk languages.

lang-pt does not remove accent

skip the lunr-languages, but process the text before feed to elasticlunr? will it work?
